# Face-Mask-Detection-using-Computer-vision
classifying accurately the masked faces non-masked faces and semi-masking human faces is the difficult and hard task for the digital image processing related algorithms the characteristics needed to correctly forecast the corresponding class and then the classification of the individual is limited from naked human face to only the eyes or maybe sometimes a forehead of a human. 
This project depends on the existing pre-train ResNet-50 framework, which is trained on human masked faces, non-masked faces, and semi-mashed faces to deal with the problem of classifying the personâ€™s class when he or she is wearing the facial mask or not.

# Methodology
By implementing the methodology of the published studies, we got the average 98% accuracy score. After the complete comparison of the all-trained models (proposed and implemented), we got the maximum 99-100% accuracy score. The implemented deep learning models showed the 99% accuracy score with significant value of precision, recall and f1-score.  The 99% accuracy extracted from the proposed models showed the low score for precision, recall and f1-score relative to the implemented model. But we also got the 100% score with our proposed model (Inception ResNet V2) with the significant score of precision, recall and f1-score relative to the implemented models.
